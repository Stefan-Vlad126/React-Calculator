A basic calculator in React.


# Basic info:
You can only use 2 numbers at a time.If you press = the first number becomes the result that way you can modify the result.
Press delete to start from scratch.


# NOTE: The application is not finished
That means a lot of features that you see in other calculators are missing:
Backspace,square root etc,
This app needs updates but I used it to test my skills in react and become better maybe I will update it maybe not who knows.
Also bugs do exist.I think.

# What can you do with it

You can use this app as an example for your calculator if you are a beginner and you don t know how to start.

OR

Copy and paste the code to flex on your friends or something like that I don t care do what you want with this.
